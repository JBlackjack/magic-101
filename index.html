           <h1>One Card Reversal</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The only set up you need is to turn over the bottom card of the pack so it is face up. <br>
            Spread
the cards and have a spectator select one. <br>
Make sure to keep the bottom face up card hidden.
While they are looking at their card, square the deck up and turn it over. <br>
The deck will appear
to be face down because the bottom card is facing down. Have their card inserted into the
deck and square the cards. <br>
Put the deck behind your back and flip the reversed card back
over. Now spread the deck face up revealing one card face down - it is the selected card!
<br>
Tips: Don't stare at your hands. Where ever you are looking, the spectator will be looking.<br>

           <h1>Checker Cards</h1>
            <br>
            <p>To prepare for this effect separate the cards into two piles of red and black. Assemble the piles
one on top of the other and you are ready to perform.
<br>Fan the faces towards you so you can
easily separate the cards into their respective piles. Place the piles face down on the table.
Have a spectator select a card from each pile and replace it in the other. Place the piles
together and square them up. <br>To locate the selected cards, run through the deck and remove
the red card from the black pile and vice versa. Be sure to keep the faces hidden from your
audience. When you are finished, shuffling the deck will destroy any evidence of a prearranged
deck.

           <h1>Four to the Top</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Remove the four jacks from the deck and three different cards as well. Hold the different cards
face up in your hand, then lay the four jacks spread out on top keeping the three different
cards concealed. <br>Show the four jacks, then square all the cards and place them face down on
top of the deck. Tell the story of four robbers robbing the bank.<br> Slide the top card off the pack
and place it into the deck near the bottom, the cellar. The next one goes in a little higher, the
first floor. The third jack above that, the second floor. The last one stays on top, the roof. <br>You
have now slid what appears to be three jacks into the deck, but in reality you only moved the
three different cards.<br> Talk about the police arriving and the only way to escape was through the
roof. Turn the top four cards over revealing the jacks.
