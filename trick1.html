<h1>TRICK 1: FOUR TO THE TOP</h1>
  </head> 
  <body>


        <p>Remove the four jacks from the deck and three different cards as <br />
           well. Hold the different cards face up in your hand, then lay the<br />
           four jacks spread out on top keeping the three different cards <br />
           concealed. Show the four jacks, then square all the cards and place <br />
           them face down on top of the deck. Tell the story of four robbers <br />
           robbing the bank. Slide the top card off the packand place it into <br />
           the deck near the bottom, the cellar. The next one goes in a little <br />
           higher, the first floor. The third jack above that, the second floor.<br /> 
           The last one stays on top, the roof. You have now slid what appears <br />
           to be three jacks into the deck, but in reality you only moved the <br />
           three different cards. Talk about the police arriving and the only <br />
           way to escape was through the roof. Turn the top four cards over <br />
           revealing the jacks.
